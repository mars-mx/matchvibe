## ü§ñ Pure AI-Coded Application

This is a **Proof-of-Concept** of a purely vibe-coded application with **0 human-written Lines of Code**.

This project utilizes Claude Code exclusively and serves as an experiment to test how effectively AI can design and implement applications without human intervention in the actual coding process.

## üî• Roast Welcome

Everyone who is skeptical about Vibe Coding and using AI Assistants is **warmly welcome to roast this code to the max**. Since there's no human to blame for any questionable design decisions or code smells, Claude won't take it personally (I hope).

Feel free to:

- Point out architectural flaws
- Highlight inefficiencies
- Mock the implementation patterns
- Question the design choices
- Laugh at the inevitable AI quirks

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: By contributing to this repository, you confirm that you are **NOT** adding any human-written lines of code. All contributions must be generated through AI assistants to maintain the purity of this experiment.

This is a scientific endeavor to see how far we can push AI-driven development without a single keystroke of human-authored code.

_Remember: This is an experiment in the limits and capabilities of AI-driven development. The code quality (or lack thereof) is part of the learning process._
