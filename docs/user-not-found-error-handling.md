# User Not Found Error Handling

This document describes the implementation of enhanced "User Not Found" error handling in MatchVibe.

## Overview

When a user enters an invalid X username in the vibe analysis form, the system now provides specific, actionable feedback instead of a generic error message.

## Error Flow

### 1. Backend Detection
- **GrokService** (`features/vibe-analysis/services/grok/grok.service.ts`) throws `NotFoundError` when a user cannot be found
- Error includes the specific username that was not found

### 2. API Response
- **API Route** (`app/api/vibe/analyze/route.ts`) catches `NotFoundError` and returns:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "X user 'niniloves12' not found",
    "code": "USER_NOT_FOUND", 
    "details": { "username": "niniloves12" }
  }
  ```
- Uses 404 status code instead of generic 500

### 3. Frontend Handling
- **VibeAnalysisPage** (`features/vibe-analysis/components/vibe-analysis-page.tsx`) detects the specific error
- Shows enhanced error UI with:
  - Specific message: "X user '@niniloves12' not found"
  - Visual highlighting of which user was not found
  - Helpful guidance text
  - Suppressed generic error toast

## User Experience

**Before:**
- Generic "Something went wrong" message
- No indication of which user caused the issue
- Generic error toast notification

**After:**  
- Specific "X user '@username' not found" message
- Visual highlighting showing which of the two users was invalid
- Helpful hint about checking spelling and account privacy
- No confusing generic error notifications

## Implementation Details

### Error Detection Pattern
```javascript
if (error.status === 404 && 
    error.details && 
    typeof error.details === 'object' && 
    'username' in error.details) {
  // Handle USER_NOT_FOUND specifically
}
```

### Visual Feedback
- Invalid username is highlighted with red background
- Valid username shown with normal styling
- Clear "Ã—" separator between usernames

### Toast Suppression
```javascript
// Skip toast for user not found errors since we handle them with specific UI
if (error.status === 404 && error.details && 'username' in error.details) {
  return; // Don't show generic toast
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Feedback**: Users immediately know which username is invalid
2. **Actionable**: Users can correct the specific username that's wrong
3. **Professional**: Shows polished error handling instead of generic failures
4. **Debuggable**: Maintains proper logging for development and monitoring
5. **Consistent**: Follows existing error handling patterns in the codebase

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with mock data to verify:
- Backend correctly maps NotFoundError to 404 + USER_NOT_FOUND
- Frontend properly detects and handles the specific error response
- Visual highlighting works for both user1 and user2 scenarios
- Generic error handling remains unchanged for other error types
